# C++ Days 42

Welcome to Day 42 of your C++ learning journey! In this README, you will find important information about today's topics, objectives, and resources. 

## Today's Topics

- **Concurrency in C++**
  - Multithreading
  - Mutexes and Locks
  - Condition Variables
  - Futures and Promises

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you should be able to:

1. Understand the basics of multithreading in C++.
2. Use mutexes and locks to protect shared resources in a multithreaded environment.
3. Implement condition variables for synchronizing threads.
4. Create asynchronous tasks using futures and promises.

## Getting Started

Before diving into today's topics, make sure you have a C++ development environment set up on your machine. You may use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, CLion, or simply a text editor and the command line tools.

## Resources

Here are some resources to help you learn about today's topics:

- **Multithreading in C++:**
  - [C++ Multithreading Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-cpp/): A comprehensive tutorial on multithreading in C++.
  - [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.amazon.com/C-Concurrency-Action-Anthony-Williams/dp/1617294691): A book by Anthony Williams that covers C++ concurrency in depth.

- **Mutexes and Locks:**
  - [std::mutex - C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex): Official C++ reference for std::mutex.
  - [C++ Mutex Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-lock-for-linux-thread-synchronization/): An introductory tutorial on mutexes in C++.

- **Condition Variables:**
  - [std::condition_variable - C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable): Official C++ reference for std::condition_variable.
  - [C++ Condition Variable Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/condition-variable-in-cpp/): A tutorial on using condition variables in C++.

- **Futures and Promises:**
  - [std::future and std::promise - C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future): Official C++ reference for std::future and std::promise.
  - [C++ Futures and Promises Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/future-promise-c/): An introductory tutorial on futures and promises in C++.

## Exercises and Projects

To reinforce your learning, consider working on the following:

1. **Multithreading Practice**: Write a C++ program that demonstrates multithreading using std::thread. Create multiple threads to perform different tasks concurrently and ensure proper synchronization.

2. **Mutex Experiment**: Extend the above program to include shared data and protect it using std::mutex and locks.

3. **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Implement a solution to the classic producer-consumer problem using threads, mutexes, and condition variables.

4. **Asynchronous Task**: Write a program that uses std::future and std::promise to perform a time-consuming task asynchronously.

## Additional Notes

Remember that concurrency can be challenging due to issues like race conditions and deadlocks. Always pay attention to synchronization mechanisms to ensure the correctness of your multithreaded programs.

Enjoy your journey into C++ concurrency, and happy coding!
